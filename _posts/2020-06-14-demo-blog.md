Here is latex version for equation.

```latex
$$ E = mc^2 $$
```

$$ E = mc^2 $$

```latex
$$ a = b + c $$
```

$$ a = b + c $$

```latex
$$ 
\begin{align*}
a &= c + d \\
d &= x + y
\end{align*}
$$
```

$$ 
\begin{align*}
a &= c + d \\
d &= x + y
\end{align*}
$$

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
x+y&=1\\
x-y&=0
\end{array}
\right.
$$
```

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
x+y&=1\\
x-y&=0
\end{array}
\right.
$$

For inline equation, just type ```$E=mc^2$```, and you will have the output as $E=mc^2$.
